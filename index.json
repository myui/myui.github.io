However, live exploration-based query execution, in accordance with the Linked Open Data publishing principles, dereferences Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRI)s on the fly in order to provide results from Linked Data anywhere on the Web. We propose and investigate similarity search-based strategies for dereferencing IRIs during live exploration-based querying in order to maximise user criteria of coverage, freshness and diversity within a limited execution time, in contrast to existing approaches which may provide complete results but within response times that are too high to be useful within many practical applications. Results are presented from a set of sample queries comparing the IRI selection strategies with existing approaches showing that coverage, freshness and diversity can be improved by up to 30%.","tags":[],"title":"Optimising Coverage, Freshness and Diversity in Live Exploration-based Linked Data Queries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1401753600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1401753600,"objectID":"4f28c2181e37ca770a0e333eb9be7821","permalink":"https://myui.github.io/talk/hadoop_summit14/","publishdate":"2014-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/hadoop_summit14/","section":"talk","summary":"Gave a talk titled `Hivemall: Scalable Machine Learning Library for Apache Hive Hadoop`.
