Leading the development of a large scale machine learning service (ML-as-a-Service) in Treasure Data cloud service. My work has became productized as the heart of [CDP predictive scoring](https://www.treasuredata.com/product/segmentation/) (Predictive models with automated feature engineering) and Content Affinity Engine (Data augumentation of user interests). 

Also, I worked on a workflow management system (OSS'd as [Digdag](https://www.digdag.io/)) and it's next generation Docker runtime design and implementation. A number of customers are using it for running/managing machine learning workflows.

Consulted industrial segments includes: Telecom, Insurance, Automobile, Ad-tech, EC, Media Agency, Internet-related Service, Real-estate, Gaming, and Online Publishers. My consulting work for Subaru is featured by CEO's talk at Softbank world. Those consulting gave me precious and unique experiece applying ML to diverse domain problems.
