* Internship management
I initiated and organized Summer Internship program from 2015 to 2018 and mentored a number of students. We [implemented various Ranking measure and anonaly detection algorithms](https://speakerdeck.com/takuti/treasure-data-summer-internship-2016). Another student worked on [Field-aware Factorization Machines and online Kernel SVM](https://www.slideshare.net/SotaroSugimoto/spring-2016-intern-at-treasure-data).
We successfully finished the intership program and 5 master students joined to Treasure Data in the past 3 years. This accomplishments are what I'm proud of.

* Consulting
Aside from development tasks, I consulted 20~30 customer-facing machine learning projects from Fortune 500 companies to foreign startups (Indonesia, Taipei, Israel). Consulted industrial segments includes: Telecom, Insurance, Automobile, Ad-tech, EC, Media Agency, Internet-related Service, Real-estate, Gaming, and Online Publishers. My consulting work for Subaru is featured by CEO's talk at Softbank world. Those consulting gave me precious and unique experiece applying ML to diverse domain problems.
