abstract: Centralised indexes and distributed query federation-based approaches towards executing queries over distributed Linked Open Data are currently limited when it comes to providing complete coverage and up-to-date results. However, live exploration-based query execution, in accordance with the Linked Open Data publishing principles, dereferences Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRI)s on the fly in order to provide results from Linked Data anywhere on the Web. We propose and investigate similarity search-based strategies for dereferencing IRIs during live exploration-based querying in order to maximise user criteria of coverage, freshness and diversity within a limited execution time, in contrast to existing approaches which may provide complete results but within response times that are too high to be useful within many practical applications. Results are presented from a set of sample queries comparing the IRI selection strategies with existing approaches showing that coverage, freshness and diversity can be improved by up to 30%.
